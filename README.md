# Tower Defense Game

## Game Overview
In this game, your mission is to defend your **Main Castle** from waves of enemies that spawn from **Enemy Spawners**. You will strategically place towers to destroy the incoming enemies and prevent them from reaching your castle. Each wave increases in difficulty, with more enemies and tougher challenges. Try to reach the highest score possible before your castle is destroyed!

## How to Play

### Objective:
- Defend your **Main Castle** by placing **Towers** on the map.
- **Kill enemies** to earn **Gold**.
- Use **Gold** to build more towers or upgrade existing ones.
- Survive as many waves as possible and aim for the highest score before the **Main Castle** is destroyed.

### Basic Mechanics:
1. **Towers**: Place towers on the map to attack enemies. Each tower costs **Gold**.
2. **Gold**: You earn **Gold** by killing enemies. Use it to build new towers or upgrade existing ones.
3. **Waves**: Enemies come in waves, with each wave becoming progressively harder. Plan your defenses carefully to withstand the increasing challenge.
4. **Castle Health**: Your **Main Castle** has limited health. If enemies reach the castle, it will take damage. The game ends when the castle's health reaches zero.
5. **Score**: Your score is based on the number of enemies killed and the number of waves survived.

### Game Controls:
- **Mouse Click**: 
  - **Left Click**: Select a tower to place or upgrade.
  - **Right Click**: Cancel tower placement or return to the previous action.
- **Drag and Drop**: Drag towers from the selection panel and place them on the battlefield.
