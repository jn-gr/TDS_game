## Game Overview
In Fortress of Elements, your mission is to defend your Main Castle from waves of relentless enemies spawning from Enemy Spawners. Strategically place and upgrade towers to destroy incoming foes and prevent them from reaching your castle. Each wave grows more challenging, introducing tougher enemies and greater numbers. Test your strategy, survive as long as you can, and aim for the highest score before your castle falls!

## How to Play

### Objective:
- Defend your Main Castle by placing and upgrading Towers on the map.
- Eliminate enemies to earn Gold.
- Use Gold to build more towers or upgrade existing ones.
- Upgrade towers to harness the powers of Neutral, Fire, Water, and Air elements.
- Survive as many waves as possible while achieving the highest score.

### Basic Mechanics:
- Towers: Place towers strategically to attack and eliminate enemies. Towers can be upgraded with Gold to improve their damage, range, and attack speed. Towers can also be infused with elemental powers for special effects.  
- Gold: Earn Gold by killing enemies. Spend it wisely to build new towers, upgrade existing ones, or enhance towers with elemental powers.
- Skill Tree: Upgrade abilities in the Skill Tree using Gold. These skills provide powerful benefits that enhance your towers, increase resource gains, and improve survivability.
- Map Expansion: Expand the map as you play by choosing where to add new tiles. Strategically extend paths to create chokepoints and optimize your defenses.
- Waves: Enemies arrive in waves, with increasing numbers, health, and strength. Stay ahead of the difficulty curve by planning your defenses carefully.
- Castle Health: Your Main Castle has limited health. Each enemy that reaches the castle damages it. The game ends when the castleâ€™s health reaches zero.
- Score: Your score reflects the number of enemies killed and waves survived. Compete to reach the top score!

### Tower Types:
- Rapid Fire: A fast-shooting tower with a high attack speed, ideal for dealing with large groups of weaker enemies.
- Sniper: A long-range tower with high single-target damage, excellent for eliminating tough enemies and bosses.
- Turret: A balanced tower with moderate damage and range, designed for steady and consistent performance.
- All Towers are upgradeable by 3 tiers and also all the elements : Neutral, Fire, Water and Air.

### Enemies:

- Tier 2 Enemies: These enemies are Stronger, faster and have increased hp compared to tier 1 Enemies, also increases in difficulty over time.
